## 📖 About Me 

- I am a **Master's student in Statistical Science** at Duke University with a full-tuition scholarship. I currently work as a teaching assistant (TA) and am a member of the American Statistical Association (ASA).  

- I am collaborating with a chess grandmaster to develop a **Chess Tutor Chatbot** that provides personalized post-game feedback and strategic insights to learners.  

- During my **internship at Duke School of Medicine**, I built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict antibody yields, improving production efficiency for HIV/AIDS treatment. I presented this project to over 200 scientists at the Duke CFAR Retreat in 2024.  

- I conducted **research on statistical inference and hypothesis testing** at the Vietnam Institute of Mathematics, supported by a VinIF Vietnam research grant.  

- I was awarded the **National Mathematics Scholarship** 🏅 from the Vietnam Ministry of Training and Education, recognizing the top 1% of math students in the country.  

- Outside of work, I enjoy board games, DIY projects, and yoga.
